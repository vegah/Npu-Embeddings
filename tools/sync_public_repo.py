# NpuEmbeddings -- assemble the public repository into repo/.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
#
# THIS repository is the working one and stays private: it holds the indexed
# summaries of other people's papers, the PDFs themselves, and everything else
# that is useful to us but not ours to publish. `repo/` is the subset that is.
#
# WHAT DECIDES WHAT SHIPS
# -----------------------
# The file list comes from `git ls-files`, not from walking the filesystem.
# That is deliberate: .gitignore already encodes "does this belong in a
# repository" for the model checkpoint, the build outputs, the exported
# designs, the virtualenv and the release staging area. Reusing it means none
# of those can leak here through an oversight in a second, parallel list.
#
# On top of that, EXCLUDE below removes what is ours-to-keep-private rather
# than ours-to-publish.
#
# THE LINK PROBLEM, AND WHY IT IS THE INTERESTING PART
# ----------------------------------------------------
# docs/ and tasks/ reference the paper summaries ~38 times. Dropping the
# summaries without touching the links would ship a documentation set full of
# 404s. So links into excluded material are REWRITTEN:
#
#   research/papers/<arxiv-id>.md  ->  https://arxiv.org/abs/<arxiv-id>
#         a link to our summary becomes a citation of the actual paper, which
#         is what a public document should have had in the first place
#   any other excluded target     ->  the link text, unlinked
#
# Then everything is scanned again, and a surviving reference to excluded
# material FAILS the sync. A broken public repo is worse than an unpublished
# one, and this is the check that makes "I think I got them all" unnecessary.
#
# Env: any Python 3. Run from the repository root.
# Usage:
#   python tools\sync_public_repo.py
#   python tools\sync_public_repo.py --no-notes      # also drop research/notes
#   python tools\sync_public_repo.py --dry-run
