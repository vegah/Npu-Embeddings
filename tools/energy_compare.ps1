#
# THE DIFFERENTIAL METHOD, and why it is the whole design
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Measuring one run conflates the work with process startup, model load, xclbin
# registration and weight staging. So every configuration is measured TWICE, at
# a low and a high encode count, and the answer is the difference:
#
#     J_per_encode = (E_high - E_low) / (n_high - n_low)
#
# Everything that happens once -- startup, load, staging, the harness itself --
# is identical in both runs and cancels exactly. What remains is the marginal
# cost of an encode, which is the quantity the claim is about.
#
# The package RAPL meter covers CPU cores AND the NPU block (proven in 0034's
# control experiment: a pure-dispatch soak with zero host work raises package
# power 9.1 W over idle, against 3.9 W for the one thread that drives it). So
# both sides are measured by the same instrument, and the systematic errors of
# that instrument cancel in the comparison -- which is what makes this a
# defensible claim without external instrumentation.
#
# Usage:
#   .\tools\energy_compare.ps1                       # full matrix
#   .\tools\energy_compare.ps1 -Low 10 -High 30      # quicker
