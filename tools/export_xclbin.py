# NpuEmbeddings -- M7: export a compiled design for the C++ runtime.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
#
# The C++ runtime must not compile anything. IRON has no C++ frontend
# (docs/00-overview, ground rule 3), so the design is built once here -- at BUILD
# time, where Python is allowed -- and the two artifacts XRT actually needs are
# copied out:
#
#   final.xclbin   the configured array
#   insts.bin      the instruction stream the DPU kernel replays
#
# Everything else in the JIT cache (MLIR, CDO blobs, kernel objects) is
# intermediate and the runtime never sees it.
#
# HOW THE CACHE DIRECTORY IS IDENTIFIED
# -------------------------------------
# The JIT hashes the design into ~/.npu/cache/<hash>/ and does not return the
# path. The first version of this script snapshotted mtimes around the build and
# took whatever changed -- which silently copied the SAME xclbin into all four
# design directories, because every design was already cached and nothing
# changed at all.
#
# So the directory is identified by matching what the design provably contains:
# the runtime sequence declares its three buffers as memrefs of M*K, K*N and M*N
# elements. The runtime then asserts those same sizes before dispatching, so a
# mismatch fails loudly rather than producing plausible garbage.
#
# Env: iron env WITH iron_env.ps1 dot-sourced (compiles, so it needs the NPU
#      toolchain; it also runs the design once to force the build).
# Usage:
#   python tools\export_xclbin.py
